### 👨‍💻 About Me: 
Frontend Developer skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.js. My career began when I founded a 501(c)3 tech nonprofit, where I played a leading role in every stage of the application lifecycle, from planning and design to a statewide launch in Texas high schools. This experience not only sparked my passion for frontend development but also gave me a deep understanding of end-to-end software development from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. This insight has made me a more effective Frontend Developer, enabling me to deliver 50+ frontend features under tight deadlines with a focus on user experience and cross-functional collaboration. 

🛠️ My career has been a blend of hands-on development and leadership. I’ve built and scaled applications, focusing on web performance and user experience, and have collaborated with diverse teams to drive innovation.
